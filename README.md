# ⚾ Terraform and ECS exercise-Dev-Ops

The exercise will do the following, 
1: Create a VPC, subnets and load balancer on AWS 
2: Create a code build pipeline and also pick the image from this repo to ECR
3: Once image is captured, the image will be deployed to ECS 
4: Pubish terraform output and get the URL 

Publish the ollama to one ECS container and the Java service into another, if any changes, publish the changes to the git, push and code build will pick it from the ECR to rebuild a new instance with 0 downtime 


Steps to recreate 

1: cd /terraform 
2: run terraform init 
3: terraform plan 
4: terraform apply 


Player Service is a backend application that serves baseball player data. In addition, Player service integrates with [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md), which allows us to run the [tinyllama LLM]((https://ollama.com/library/tinyllama)) locally.




Find the URL from your Load balancer
http://player-service-alb-291170883.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/v1/chat/list-models

The LLM is running as a sidecar in this deployment. 



## Dependencies

- [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
- [maven.apache.org](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- Spring Boot 3.3.4 (with Spring Web MVC, Spring Data JPA)
- [H2 Database](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Verify system dependencies
   1. Java 17
      - Verify installation: `java -version`
   2. Maven
      - Download and install from [maven.apache.org](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
      - Verify installation, run: `mvn --version`
      - Verify java version linked to maven is Java 17 `Java version: 17.x.x`
   3. Container Manager
      - Download and install from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/)(recommended) or [podman](https://podman.io/) (alternative)
      - Verify installation, run: `docker --version` for docker

2. Clone this repository or Download the code as zip
   - run `git clone https://github.com/Intuit-A4A/backend-java-player-service.git`

## Run the application

### Part 1: Application Dependencies

1. Install application dependencies
    - From the project's root directory, run: `mvn clean install -DskipTests`

### Part 2: Run Player Service (without LLM)

1. Start the Player service

   ```shell
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. Verify the Player service is running
      1. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8080/v1/players`
      2. If the application is running successfully, you will see player data appear in the browser

### Part 3: Start LLM Docker Container

Player service integrates with Ollama 🦙, which allows us to run LLMs locally. This app runs [tinyllama](https://ollama.com/library/tinyllama) model.

- [Ollama API documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md)
- [Ollama4J SDK](https://ollama4j.github.io/ollama4j/intro)

1. Pull and run Ollama docker image and download `tinyllama` model
   - Pull Ollama docker image

    ```shell
    docker pull ollama/ollama
    ```

2. Run Ollama docker image on port 11434 as a background process

    ```shell
    docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama
    ```

3. Download and run `tinyllama` model

    ```shell
    docker exec -it ollama ollama run tinyllama
    ```

4. Test Ollama API server

    ```curl
    curl -v --location 'http://localhost:11434/api/generate' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"model": "tinyllama","prompt": "why is the sky blue?", "stream": false}'
    ```
Having trouble with docker? Try using podman as an alternative. Instructions [here](https://github.com/Intuit-A4A/backend-java-player-service/wiki/Supplemental-Materials:-Set-up-help#alternative-set-up-instructions)


### Part 4: Verify Player Service and LLM Integration

1. Ensure Player Service is running from previous instructions. If not:

    ```shell
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

2. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/list-models`
   - If the application is running successfully, you will see a json response that include information about tinyllama
